CVE-2023-41036
Macvim is a text editor for MacOS. 
Prior to version 178, Macvim makes use of an insecure interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism which could lead to a privilege escalation. 
Distributed objects are a concept introduced by Apple which allow one program to vend an interface to another program. 
What is not made clear in the documentation is that this service can vend this interface to any other program on the machine. 
The impact of exploitation is a privilege escalation to root - this is likely to affect anyone who is not careful about the software they download and use MacVim to edit files that would require root privileges. 
Version 178 contains a fix for this issue.

CVE-2023-40024
ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition analysis pipelines. 
In the `/license/` endpoint, the detailed view key is not properly validated and sanitized, which can result in a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability when attempting to access a detailed license view that does not exist.
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious scripts into the response generated by the `license_details_view` function. 
When unsuspecting users visit the page, their browsers will execute the injected scripts, leading to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or stealing sensitive information. 
This issue has been addressed in release `32.5.2`. Users are advised to upgrade. 
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
