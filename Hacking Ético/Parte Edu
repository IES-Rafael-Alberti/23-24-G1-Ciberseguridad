## CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
### Descripción

Typically, this can result in corruption of data, a crash, or code execution. 
The product may modify an index or perform pointer arithmetic that references a memory location that is outside of the boundaries of the buffer. 
A subsequent write operation then produces undefined or unexpected results.

### Termino Alternativo

Corrupción de Memoria: 
Often used to describe the consequences of writing to memory outside the bounds of a buffer, or to memory that is invalid, when the root cause is something other than a sequential copy of excessive data from a fixed starting location. 
This may include issues such as incorrect pointer arithmetic, accessing invalid pointers due to incomplete initialization or memory release, etc.
